# Professional README Generator

## Description

The objective of this project was to create a high-quality README generator. This README generates a file that contains information on what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, how to make contributions, credits, and licenses. This command-line application was created by using node.js and the inquirer package. 

## Usage

The user launches the application by using the command `node index.js` in their terminal. The user is then presented with a series of prompts where they can enter the information that will be displayed on the generated README file.
